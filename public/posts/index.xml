      <description>There are lots and lots of articles on the web describing how to save a whole webpage as PDF. They all use, more or less, the browser&amp;rsquo;s ability to print to PDF.
I needed to convert many URLs at once. Doing that manually for every URL would have been cumbersome, and that&amp;rsquo;s why I automated the process.</description>

      <description>Managing applications on Windows in enterprises is complex and cumbersome. Admins are using a variety of tools to install, uninstall or reconfigure applications silently. The most popular tool is propably Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s ConfigMgr.
While ConfigMgr (and others) makes sense for mid to large enterprises, the management is too time-consuming for smaller firms.</description>
